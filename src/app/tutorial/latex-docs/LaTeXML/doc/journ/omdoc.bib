  abstract   = {Faded  examples have been investigated in pedagogical psychology.
   The experiments suggest that  a learner can benefit from faded examples.
   For these experiments a few examples were faded manually.
   For realistic applications, however, it makes more sense to 
   generate several variants of an exercise by fading a worked example 
   and to do it automatically. For the automatic generation, a 
   suitable knowledge representation of examples and exercises is 
   required which we describe in the paper.  
   Moreover, a user-adaptive system such as {\activemath} can select
   or dynamically produce faded example and present it to the student
   in response to her learning activities and adapted to her goals,
   capabilities, previous learning experience, etc. The structures and
   metadata in the knowledge representation of the examples are the
   basis for such an adaptation. In particular, it allows to fade a variety
   of parts of the example rather than only solution steps.},

                  and semantics. To handle proof theory, our
                  institutions use an extension of traditional
                  categorical logic with sets of sentences as objects
                  instead of single sentences, and with morphisms
                  representing proofs as usual. A natural equivalence
                  relation on institutions is defined such that its
                  equivalence classes are logics. Several invariants
                  are defined for this equivalence, including a
                  Lindenbaum algebra construction, its generalization
                  to a Lindenbaum category construction that includes
                  proofs, and model cardinality spectra; these are
                  used in some examples to show logics

Although it offers an abundance of learning resources the search for educational resources is still tedious, and interoperability of e-learning systems only a wished-for goal.  What is missing is a common ground for both human and machines. While there exist standards for describing learning resources, they fail to address the instructional purpose of a resource, for instance whether a web page provides a definition or a counter-example of a concept. However, such an explicit representation of the instructional function provides humans with a shared vocabulary and can serve as the basis for the semantic interoperability for machines.  This article describes such a basis: an ontology of instructional objects (OIO) that captures the function of a learning resource.  The article starts with describing several educational Web services that can benefit from it. Then, the ontology is described in detail.}

If the objects are represented in a format different from the presentation format (e.g. as XML as opposed to HTML), a potentially expensive transformation process is required.Furthermore, caching becomes impractical depending on the degree of personalization, as the dynamic information is available at presentation time only and varies for each user.In this paper we present a flexible and efficient presentation pipeline based on a Model-View-Controller architecture, which overcomes performance problems and couples caching and personalization. It transforms single learning objects and uses a view-layer for adaptive presentation and navigation support that provides additional advantages such as incremental rendering and the easy adaption to different layout styles.Both theoretical and simulation results prove the efficency of this architecture.}
