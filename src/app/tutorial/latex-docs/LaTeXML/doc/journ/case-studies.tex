\subsection{Mathematical Document Classes}

\subsubsection{Connexions Modules}

{\cnxlatex} is a collection of {\LaTeX} macros that allow to write {\connexions} modules
without leaving the {\LaTeX} workflow. Modules are authored in {\cnxlatex} using only a
text editor, transformed to PDF and proofread as usual. In particular, the {\LaTeX}
workflow is independent of having access to the {\connexions} system, which makes
{\cnxlatex} attractive for the initial version of single-author modules.


For publication, {\cnxlatex} modules are transformed to {\cnxml} via the {\latexml}
translator and can be uploaded to the {\connexions} system.

\subsubsection{OMDoc Documents}

The \verb|omdoc| package provides an infrastructure that allows to markup {\omdoc}
documents in {\LaTeX}. It provides \verb|omdoc.cls|, a class with the and \verb|omdocdoc.sty|

\subsubsection{Slides and Presentations}

We present a document class from which we can generate both course slides and course
notes in a transparent way. Furthermore, we present a set of {\latexml} bindings for
these, so that we can also generate {\omdoc}-based course materials, e.g. for
inclusion in the {\activemath} system.
