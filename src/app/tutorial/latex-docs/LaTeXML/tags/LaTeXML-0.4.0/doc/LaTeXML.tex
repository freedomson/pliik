\title{\LaTeXML: a \LaTeX\ to \XML\ Converter; \\
       \emph{Preview Version 0.3.0}}
\author{Bruce R.~Miller}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
For many, \LaTeX\ is the prefered format for document authoring, particularly those
involving significant mathematical content and where quality typesetting is desired.
On the other hand, content-oriented \XML\ is an extremely useful representation for documents,
allowing them to be used, and reused, for a variety of purposes, not least, 
presentation on the Web. Yet, the style and intent of \LaTeX\ markup, as compared to \XML\
markup, not to mention its programmability, presents difficulties in converting
documents from the former format to the latter.
Perhaps ironically, these difficulties can be particularly large for mathematical material, 
where there is a tendency for the markup to focus on appearance rather than meaning.

The choice of \LaTeX\ for authoring, and \XML\ for delivery were natural and uncontroversial
choices for the \URL[Digital Library of Mathematical Functions]{http://dlmf.nist.gov}.
Faced with the need to perform this conversion and the lack of suitable tools to perform it, 
the DLMF project proceeded to develop thier own tool, \LaTeXML, for this purpose.
This document describes a \emph{preview} release of \LaTeXML.

The idealistic goals of \LaTeXML\ are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Faithful emulation of \TeX's behaviour.
\item Easily extensible.
\item Lossless; preserving both semantic and presentation cues.
\item Uses abstract \LaTeX-like, extensible, document type.
\item Determine the semantics of mathematical content\\
    (Content \MathML, \emph{Good} Presentation \MathML, eventually \OpenMath).
\end{itemize}

As these goals are not entirely practical, or even somewhat contradictory,
they are implicitly modified by ``as much as possible.''
Completely mimicing \TeX's behaviour would seem to require the sneakiest modifications
to \TeX, itself.  `Ease of use' is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.
More significantly, few documents are likely to have completely unambiguous
mathematics markup; human understanding of both the topic and the surrounding 
text is needed to properly interpret any particular fragment.
Thus, rather than pretend to provide a `turn-key' solution,
we expect that document-specific declarations or tuning to be necessary
to faithfully convert documents.  Towards this end, we provide a variety
of means to customize the processing and declare the author's intent.
At the same time, especially for new documents, we encourage a more logical, 
content-oriented markup style, over a purely presentation-oriented style.

\medskip
This document continues with an overview of the usage of \LaTeXML (\S\ref{sec:usage})
and its architecture (\S\ref{sec:architecture}).   
In \S\ref{sec:packages}, an overview of customizing \LaTeXML\ is given.
How mathematics is converted to content-oriented forms is discussed in \S\ref{sec:math}.
Finally, Appendix \ref{app:hierarchy} shows an object hierarchy of the system
and Appendix \ref{app:todo} lists the main problem areas and unfinished features.

In general, for more detail, you should see the perl documentation of various
\LaTeXML\ Packages (using, for example, the command \texttt{perldoc LaTeXML}),
or the source code itself, and the examples.

\section{Using \LaTeXML}\label{sec:usage}
The basic conversion to \XML\ (using the \LaTeXML\ DTD, by default) is carried out
by the command:
\begin{quote}
 \cmd{latexml \textit{options} document.tex > document.xml}
\end{quote}
This command reads and processes the \TeX\ document \texttt{document.tex},
along with any document-specific customization (see \S\ref{sec:packages})
in \texttt{document.latexml}, if present,
and constructs an \XML\ document from it.  The document tree is then subjected to various 
rewriting before being passed to the mathematics parser.  The parser applies a grammar based
recursive descent parser to the mathematical content in an attempt to convert
to semantic forms.  (Or, at least to structure consistent with the semantics).

Additional transformations, such as to \HTML, \MathML\ or other formats, are carried out
by stylesheets or postprocessing modules in the postprocessor \cmd{latexmlpost}:
\begin{quote}
\cmd{latexmlpost \textit{options} document.xml}
\end{quote}

See the documentation for the commands \pkg{latexml} and \pkg{latexmlpost} for details
and description of command options\footnote{Use \texttt{latexml --help} or 
\texttt{perldoc latexml} to view the documentation}.

\section{Architectural Overview}\label{sec:architecture}
Like \TeX, \LaTeXML\ is data-driven: the text and executable control
sequences (ie.~macros and primitives)
in the source file (and any packages loaded) direct the processing.
The user exerts control over the conversion, and customizes it, by 
providing alternative \LaTeXML-specific implementations of the control sequences and packages,
by declaring properties of the desired document structure,
and by defining rewrite rules to be applied to the constructed document tree.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dataflow}
\caption{Flow of data through \LaTeXML's digestive tract.\label{fig:dataflow}}
\end{figure}
The top-level class, \LTXLaTeXML, manages the processing, providing several methods
for converting a \TeX\ document or string into an \XML\ document, with varying degrees
of postprocessing and optionally writing the document to file.
A \LTXState\ object maintains the current state
of processing, current definitions for control sequences and emulates the
\TeX's scoping rules.
The processing is broken into two phases; the \TeX-like digestion phase and
the \XML\ construction phase; See Figure \ref{fig:dataflow}.

\emph{Digestion} is carried out primarily in a \emph{pull} mode, with the \LTXStomach\
pulling expanded  \LTXToken's from a \LTXGullet, which, itself pulls tokens from 
a \LTXMouth.  The \LTXMouth\ converts characters from the plain text input into tokens according
to the current category codes assigned to them (in the \LTXState).  
The \LTXGullet\ is responsible for expanding any macro or expandible
tokens (when the current binding of the token in the \LTXState\ is an \LTXExpandable\ definition), 
and for parsing sequences of tokens into common core datatypes (numbers, dimensions, etc.).
The \LTXStomach\ digests these tokens by executing \LTXPrimitive\ control 
sequences (generally for side effect), converting control sequences bound
to \LTXConstructor's into \LTXWhatsit's, and converting the remaining tokens
into a recursive structure of \LTXList's and \LTXBox's.

The main (intentional) deviation of \LaTeXML's digestion from that of \TeX\ is in the
extension of control sequences to include \LTXConstructor's responsible for constructing
\XML\ document fragments, and \LTXWhatsit's to represent thier digested form including
whatever arguments were passed to the control sequence.

\emph{Construction} of the document thus consists of creating an \LTXDocument, containing
an \code{XML::LibXML::Document} structure, and having it absorb the digested lists, boxes
and whatsits.  Generally, boxes represent text which is converted to text nodes within the
document. Whatsits generally create a document fragment involving elements, attributes
and text.  

A \LTXModel\ is maintained througout the digestion phase which accumulates
any document model declarations in particular the document type (currently only
the DTD, but eventually may be RelaxNG based).  As \LaTeX\ markup is more
like \SGML\ than \XML, declarations may be used to indicate which elements may
be automatically opened or closed when needed to build a document tree that matches
the document type.  As an example, a \verb|<subsection>| will automaticall be closed
when a \verb|<section>| is begun.

Once the basic document is constructed, \LTXRewrite\ rules are applied which can
perform various functions. Ligatures and combining mathematics digits and letters (in certain fonts)
into composite math tokens are handled this way.  Additionally, declarations
of the type or grammatical role of math tokens can be applied here.
Finally, the \LTXMathParser\ is invoked which attempts to understand the mathematical
content;  See \ref{sec:math} for more details.

The \LTXLaTeXML\ object binds \verb|$STATE|, \verb|$GULLET|, \verb|$STOMACH|,
and \verb|$MODEL| to corresponding active objects during processing.

\section{Implementation and Customization}\label{sec:packages}
The processsing of the \LaTeX\ document and its  conversion into \XML\ is affected
by the definitions of control sequences, either as macros, primitives or constructors, 
and other declarations specifying the document type, properties of \XML\ tags, ligatures, \ldots.
These definitions and declarations are typically contained in `packages' which provide
the implementation of \LaTeX\ classes and packages.  For example, the \LaTeX\ directive
\verb|\usepackage{foo}| would cause \LaTeXML\ to load the file \code{foo.ltxml}.
This file would be sought in any of the directories in perl's \verb|@INC| list (typically
including the current directory), or in a \verb|LaTeXML/Package| subdirectory of any of 
those directories.  If no such file is found, \LaTeXML\ would look for \code{foo.sty} and
attempt to process it.

When processing a typical file, say \textit{jobname}\texttt{.tex}, 
the following packages are loaded:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the core \code{TeX} package
\item any packages named with the \verb|--preload| option,
\item a file \textit{jobname}\texttt{.latexml}, if present;
      this provides for document-specific declarations.
\end{enumerate}
Document processing then commences; by default, \LaTeXML\ assumes that the document is plain \TeX.
However, if a \verb|\documentclass| directive is encountered, the \code{LaTeX} package, as well
as a package for the named document class are loaded.

\LaTeXML\ implementations are provided for a number of the standard \LaTeX\ packages,
although many implement only part of the functionality.  Contributed implementations are,
of course, welcome.  These files, as well as the document specific \textit{jobname}\texttt{.latexml},
are essentially Perl modules, but use the facilities described in \perldoc{LaTeXML::Package}.

\section{Mathematics}\label{sec:math}
The mathematical material is parsed into a content-oriented representation following
the usual steps: lexical scanning, grammar-based parsing and (eventually) type-analysis, but
with a few twists. As \LaTeXML\ constructs the initial document, the mathematical material
is converted mainly into a sequence of lexical (mathmematical) tokens (\tag{XMTok}), 
possibly carrying extra information such as name, grammatical role, font, style, etc.  
The exceptions are where the mathematical structure is clear from the markup itself, 
such as \verb|\frac| or sub- and superscripts, where a generalized \emph{application} (\tag{XMApp})
is constructed.  The substructures will typically play no role in the parsing of the upper 
layer of tokens; they are wrapped (in an \tag{XMArg} or \tag{XMWrap} element) and parsed
as separate subexpressions.  At this level, we can think of \LaTeXML\ as being
a \emph{structure preserving} lexer.  

The parser, invoked by the postprocessor, works only with the top-level lists of lexical tokens,
or with those sublists contained in an \tag{XMArg}.  The grammar works primarily through
the name and grammatical role.  The name is given by an attribute, or the content if it is
the same.  The role (things like ID, FUNCTION, OPERATOR, OPEN, \ldots) is also given
by an attribute, or, if not present, the name is looked up in a document-specific
dictionary (\textit{jobname}\texttt{.dict}), or in a default dictionary.

Additional exceptions that need fuller explanation are: 
(1) \LTXConstructor s may wish to create a dual object (\tag{XMDual}) whose children are 
the semantic and presentational forms.
(2) Spacing and similar markup generates \tag{XMHint} elements, which are currently ignored
during parsing, but probably shouldn't.

\section{Math Details}\label{app:math}
\LaTeXML\ processes mathematical material by proceeding through several stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic processing of macros, primitives and constructors resulting in
   an XML document; the math is primarily represented by a sequence of
   tokens (\tag{XMTok}) or structured items (\tag{XMApp}, \tag{XMDual}) and
   hints (\tag{XMHint}, which are ignored).
\item Document tree rewriting, where rules are applied to modify the document tree.
   User supplied rules can be used here to clarify the intent of markup used in the document.
\item Math Parsing; a grammar based parser is applied, depth first, to each level of the math.
   In particular, at the top level of each math expression, as well as each
   subexpression within structured items (these will have been contained in
   an \tag{XMArg} or \tag{XMWrap} element).  This results in an expression tree
   that will hopefully be an accurate representation of the expression's structure,
   but may be ambigous in specifics (eg.`what the meaning of a superscript is).
\item \emph{Not yet implemented} a following stage must be developed to resolve
   the semantic ambiguities by analyzing and augmenting the expression tree.
\item Target conversion: from the internal \tag{XM} representation to
   \MathML\ or \OpenMath.
\end{itemize}

The \tag{Math} element is a top-level container for any math mode material; it
serves as the container for the various representations of the math, including
images (through attributes \attr{mathimage}, \attr{width} and \attr{height}), 
textual (through attributes \attr{tex}, \attr{content-tex} and \attr{text}),
\MathML\ and the internal representation itself.  
The \attr{mode} attribute specifies whether the math should be in display or inline mode.

\subsection{Internal Math Resentation}\label{app:mathrep}
The \tag{XMath} element is the container for the internal representation

The following attributes can appear on all \tag{XM} elements:
\begin{description}
\item[\attr{role}] the grammatical role that this element plays 
\item[\attr{open}, \attr{close}] parenthese or delimiters that were used to wrap the
   expression represented by this element.
\item[\attr{argopen}, \attr{argclose}, \attr{separators}] delimiters on an function or operator
   (the first element of an \tag{XMApp})  that were used to delimit the arguments of the function.
    The separators is a string of the punctuation characters used to separate arguments.
\item[\attr{xml:id}] a unique identifier to allow reference (\tag{XMRef}) to this element.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Math Tags} The following tags are used for the intermediate math representation:
\begin{description}
\item[\tag{XMTok}] represents a math token. It may contain text for presentation.
   Additional attributes are:
  \begin{description}
   \item[\attr{name}] the name that represents the `meaning' of the token; this overrides
      the content for identifying the token.
   \item[\attr{omcd}] the \OpenMath\ content dictionary that the name belongs to.
   \item[\attr{font}] the font to be used for presenting the content.
   \item[\attr{style}] ?
   \item[\attr{size}] ?
   \item[\attr{stackscripts}] whether scripts should be stacked above/below the item, instead
     of the usual script position.
  \end{description}
\item[\tag{XMApp}] represents the generalized application of some function or operator to arguments.
   The first child element is the operator, the remainig elements are the arguments.
   Additional attributes:
  \begin{description}
    \item[\attr{name}] the name that represents the meaning of the construct as a whole.
    \item[\attr{stackscripts}] ?
  \end{description}
\item[\tag{XMDual}] combines representations of the content (the first child) and presentation
   (the second child), useful when the two structures are not easily related.
\item[\tag{XMHint}] represents spacing or other apparent purely presentation material.
  \begin{description}
    \item[\attr{name}] names the effect that the hint was intended to achieve.
    \item[\attr{style}] ?
  \end{description}
\item[\tag{XMWrap}] serves to assert the expected type or role of a subexpression that
  may otherwise be difficult to interpret --- the parser is more forgiving about these.
  \begin{description}
    \item[\attr{name}] ?
    \item[\attr{style}] ?
  \end{description}
\item[\tag{XMArg}] serves to wrap individual arguments or subexpressions, created by
  structured markup, such as \verb|\frac|.  These subexpressions can be parsed individually.
  \begin{description}
    \item[\attr{rule}] the grammar rule that this subexpression should match.
  \end{description}
\item[\tag{XMRef}] refers to another subexpression,.  This is used to avoid duplicating
  arguments when constructing an \tag{XMDual} to represent a function application, for example.  
  The arguments will be placed in the content branch (wrapped in an \tag{XMArg}) while
  \tag{XMRef}'s will be placed in the presentation branch.
  \begin{description}
    \item[\attr{idref}] the identifier of the referenced math subexpression.
  \end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection{Grammatical Roles}\label{app:mathroles}
The following grammatical roles are recognized by the math parser.
These values can be specified in the \attr{role} attribute during the initial 
document construction or by rewrite rules.  Although the precedence of operators
is loosely described in the following, since the grammar contains various special
case productions, no rigidly ordered precedence is given.
\begin{description}
\item[\code{ATOM}] a general atomic subexpression.
\item[\code{ID}] a variable-like token, whether scalar or otherwise.
\item[\code{PUNCT}] punctuation.
\item[\code{APPLYOP}] an explicit infix application operator (high precedence).
\item[\code{RELOP}] a relational operator, loosely binding.
\item[\code{ARROW}] an arrow operator (with little semantic significance).
  treated equivalently to \code{RELOP}.
\item[\code{METARELOP}] an operator used for relations between relations, with lower precedence.
\item[\code{ADDOP}] an addition operator, precedence between relational and multiplicative operators.
\item[\code{MULOP}] a multiplicative operator, high precedence.
\item[\code{SUPOP}] An operator appearing in a superscript, such as a collection of primes.
\item[\code{OPEN}] an open delimiter.
\item[\code{CLOSE}] a close delimiter.
\item[\code{MIDDLE}] a middle operator used to group items between an \code{OPEN}, \code{CLOSE} pair.
\item[\code{OPERATOR}] a general operator; higher precedence than function application.
  For example, for an operator $A$, and function $F$, $A F x$ would be interpretted as $(A(F))(x)$.
\item[\code{SUMOP}] a summation/union operator.
\item[\code{INTOP}] an integral operator.
\item[\code{LIMITOP}] a limiting operator.
\item[\code{DIFFOP}] a differential operator.
\item[\code{BIGOP}] a general operator, but lower precedence, such as a $P$ preceding
  an integral to denote the principal value.
 Note that \code{SUMOP}, \code{INTOP}, \code{LIMITOP}, \code{DIFFOP} and \code{BIGOP} are treated
 equivalently by the grammar, but are distinguished to facilitate (\emph{eventually!}) 
 analyzing the argument structure (eg bound variables and differentials within an integral).
 \textbf{Note} are \code{SUMOP} and \code{LIMITOP} significantly different in this sense?
\item[\code{VERTBAR}]
\item[\code{FUNCTION}] a function which (may) apply to following arguments with higher
   precedence than addition and multiplication, or parenthesized arguments.
\item[\code{NUMBER}] a number.
\item[\code{POSTSUPERSCRIPT}] the usual superscript, where the script is treated as
  an argument, but the base will be determined by parsing. Note that this is not
  necessarily assumed to be a power. Very high precedence.
\item[\code{POSTSUBSCRIPT}] Similar to \code{POSTSUPERSCRIPT} for subscripts.
\item[\code{FLOATINGSUPERSCRIPT}] A special case for a superscript on an empty base,
  ie. \verb|{}^{x}|.  This is often used to place a pre-superscript or for
  non-math uses (eg. \verb|10${}^{th}|).
\item[\code{FLOATINGSUBSCRIPT}] Similar to \code{POSTSUPERSCRIPT} for subscripts.
\item[\code{POSTFIX}] for a postfix operator
\item[\code{UNKNOWN}] an unknown expression. This is the default for token elements,
  and generates a warning if the unknown seems to be used as a function.
\end{description}

% Some 
\section{Issues and ToDo}\label{app:todo}
Lots\ldots!
\begin{itemize}
\item Lots of useful \LaTeX\ packages have not been implemented, and those
  that are aren't necessarily complete.
\item \TeX\ boxes aren't really complete, and in particular things like \verb|\ht0|
  don't work.
\item Possibly useful to override (pre-override?) a macro defined in the source file;
  that is, define it and silently ignore the definition given in the source.
\item \ldots um, \ldots \emph{documentation}!
