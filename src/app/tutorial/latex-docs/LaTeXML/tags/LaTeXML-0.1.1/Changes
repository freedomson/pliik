0.1.1 2004-06-15
      - Packages:
        * Made package loading more robust; doesn't re-load;
	* Crude access to options
	* Added several missing definitions to TeX & LaTeX
	* Implemented comment, acronym packages;
	  initial (mostly empty) amssymb

      - General:
        * Catch filters that don't actually change the input.
	* Refactoring: New module Global.pm carries all exported
	  constants and constructors to simplify coding.
	* Refactoring: name changes & code movement of methods
	  confusingly called `digestFoo' and similar.
	* Refactoring: Moved macro parameter handling to new
	  module Parameters.pm (and as side-effect had to
	  rename parameters to Register (DefRegister, etc))
	* More careful Token equals method, so newline can convert to
	  a T_SPACE w/ newline inside; this means the output nominally
	  preserves lines! (but STOMACH->setValue('preserveNewLines',0);
	  disables it).
	* New constructor \@VALUE fetches values from stomach during
	  absorbtion in intestines. This (or similar) used to put
	  reference numbers in \ref, like 2nd LaTeX pass.

      - Math:
        * Introduced new element <Math> which can contain the various
	  alternative representations of math, such as XMath, m:math, ...
	  Moved most of XMath's attributes to Math.

      - Error/Warning Messages
        * Added messages to show progress during processing (unless -quiet)
	* New SalvageError message for things that in principle are errors,
	  but we're going to try to proceed; added some things to this category,
	  like unknown macros, and such.
	* Added source locator to Whatsit to improve error messages.

      - PostProcessing:
        * Fixed xml catalog so it finds mathml dtd and entity files
	* Fixed latexmlpost and LaTeXML::Post to recognize html and xhtml
	  output formats; refined the stylesheets (LaTeXML-html.xsl and
	  LaTeXML-xhtml.xsl (both of which include LaTeXML-base.xsl))

      - Put LaTeXML tags in thier own namespace:
            http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML
	And first pass at fixing postprocessors to recognize this
	[probably introduced bugs, and in any case, namespace normalization
	 is pretty crummy]

      - NEED TO DO:
      	* Implement alltt package
	* Question: Should XMath be duplicated before parsing?
	  (ie w/different status=tokenized|parsed|partially-parsed|....)
	  This would allow more inference and then re-run the parser.
	* Extend constructor syntax to work with KeyVals, apply random functions?
	* Refactor DOM? eg. use XML::LibXML, move more analysis to Intestine
	  this needs (at least) resorting Font reduction.

      Thanks to Michael Kohlhase <m.kohlhase@iu-bremen.de> for comments & examples
      leading to many of these patches.
