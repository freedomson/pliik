This is the area of LaTeX packages with integrated bindings contributed to LaTeXML.
Some of this material may eventually end up in the LaTeXML distribution if it is mature enouth. 

Manifest
--------
README:    this file
lib: 	   auxiliary files (make, packages, utilities)
Makefile:  automation (only on POSIX system I am afraid)
<else>:   directories with contributed packages

The contributed packages with LaTeXML bindings in this directory use the LaTeX workflow 
for self-documenting packages and have the bindings in the same *.dtx file 
(see the webgraphic package for an example). The Makefiles here give an automated 
build procedure and prepare inclusion into CTAN.
